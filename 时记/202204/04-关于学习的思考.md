# Reflections on Learning
At the beginnig of my thinking，I would like to start by stating what is learing.
In my opinion, it is not easy to define learning. Because everingthing in the world is a rule, and the rules are complex and it is difficult to find a unified way to intervene.
In other words, the rules may exists in the form of a nested structure similar to a miniaturely carved ball from China.Between the layers, there are also dense connections.And then maybe, we're part of that rule.
On the basis of the above understanding, we need to know that learning can be divided into several catogories and there are many ways to divide it.Here, I divided learning into two catogories through the perspective of the learning process.
They are Cut Learning , Merge Leaning and Random Leaning.
It is important to note that these two leaning styles are indispensable to each other and are not completely independent of each other.
Next, we start to discuss how to practice and the senario of doing it.

## OverView
Doing a logical deduction or a math problem, completing a project, or pursing a beloved girl is essentially not much different from pouring a glass of water.
They all have a beginnig of a state, an end point of a state. Some states are detached from the physical , and exists in the abstract world. And some states are very secular, even ugly, but these states live in the rules of this world. Apart from the value orientations given by present history, they are equally operated and existed for this word, and the laws they follow are the same.
## Cut Learning
## Merge Learning
## Random Leaning
## a Simple and Feasible Approach
In order to learn a subject or technology, we need to the following things.
1. 尽可能收集前人对于这个学科（同样指技术）的总结，最好是以框架的形式，无论看不看得懂，都可以在比较疲惫的时候去反复观看。但是不建议浪费太多的时间。
2. 找到一门课程，从最基础最简单的步骤开始学习，并且辅助以同步配套练习。
3. 定期对于学习进行自我总结，可以根据需要划分总结的层次，并且尝试在层次之间找到联系。
4. 在学习到一定阶段之后，可以开展一些较大的实际项目或者进行一些更大范围的测试。
5. 可以随机的搜索并且听取不同人对于这门学科的意见，或者某些小点不同的看法。

### 对于考研数学
反复，渐进
每一轮不求搞懂所有的内容，但是一定要把所有没有解决的问题记录下来。
每一轮分为三个阶段：听课，看书，刷题，总结
时间紧的话就把每个阶段串行，能进行多少轮就多少轮。

#### 数学笔记如何记录？
- 刷题过程中可能会出现各种各样的灵光、遇到各种各样新奇的解法。这时直接记录在刷题纸空白处就好。
- 每天晚上需要对刷题纸进行归档，将每日归档处设为一个专门的本子，每天进行小小的分类。
- 对于每日归档处设一个每周归档处，每周日对本周的内容进行归档。
- 在一个阶段过去后，将所有的周档归结一下，总结在阶段归档本中。
- 对理论和题型的思考和总结放在一个本子，对公式的总结放在一个本子。
