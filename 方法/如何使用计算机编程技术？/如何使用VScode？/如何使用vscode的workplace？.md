The concept of a workspace enables VS Code to:
- Configure settings that only apply to a specific folder or folders but not others.
- Persist [task](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks) and [debugger launch](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) configurations that are only valid in the context of that workspace.
- Store and restore UI state associated with that workspace (for example, the files that are opened).
- Selectively enable or disable extensions only for that workspace.

## [How do I open a VS Code "workspace"?](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspaces#_how-do-i-open-a-vs-code-workspace)
The easiest way to open a workspace is using the **File** menu and selecting one of the available folder entries for opening. Alternatively if you launch VS Code from a terminal, you can pass the path to a folder as the first argument to the `code` command for opening.
