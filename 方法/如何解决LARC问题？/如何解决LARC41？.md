1. Copy input_grid to the output_grid
2. Separate out several green pixel blocks. Each green pixel block consists of two small square named S connections.
3. The separated green pixel  blocks form a large squre.Each large squre consist of four small squres.Each green pixel blocks obtained by the seperation of the second step becomes the diagonal A of each large squre.
4. Get the diagonal lines A of the green pixel blocks in each large squre.
5. Obtain diagonal B perpendicular to the diagonal A of each large squre.
6. On the outside of the large squre, paint each block of pixels comparable in size to a small square S in the direction of the corresponding diagonal B in teal color.
7. If the teal color is painted outside the boundry, it is ignored.

1. 将输入网格复制到输出网格
2. 分离出若干的绿色像素块。每个绿色像素块由两块较小的名为S的正方形连接而成
3. 分离得到的绿色像素块形成大正方形。每个大正方形由四个小正方形构成。每个由第二步分离得到的绿色像素块生成了每个大正方形的对角线A。
4. 得到每个大正方形中由绿色像素块形成的对角线A
5. 在每个大正方形中生成与对应的对角线A垂直的对角线B
6. 在大正方形的外色，将对应的对角线B方向上的小正方形s大小的像素块涂成teal色
7. 如果填涂teal色时超出边界，忽视。

You are a skilled Python programmer. Your task is to write Python code to transform the input grid into the output grid. In the input grid, you should see you should see a 10x10 grid with black , teal and green pixels. To make the output grid, you should use abstraction and reasoning abilities. 
1. Copy input_grid to the output_grid.
2. Separate out several green pixel blocks. Each green pixel block consists of two small square named S connections.
3. The separated green pixel  blocks form a large squre.Each large squre consist of four small squres.Each green pixel blocks obtained by the seperation of the second step becomes the diagonal A of each large squre.
4. Get the diagonal lines A of the green pixel blocks in each large squre.
5. Obtain diagonal B perpendicular to the diagonal A of each large squre.
6. On the outside of the large squre, paint each block of pixels comparable in size to a small square S in the direction of the corresponding diagonal B in teal color.
7. If the teal color is painted outside the boundry, it is ignored.
